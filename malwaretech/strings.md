## Strings1 1

First, i'm going to open the executable on ida (the challenge have to be solved without running it), and see the strings

![strings10](/images/malwaretech-strings/strings10.png)


Now i'll start to see the assembly of the start function

![strings11](/images/malwaretech-strings/strings11.png)

The first lines are common, but the let's see what does mov eax, off_432294, this moves the value of that memory address into EAX, so click two times on the name off_432294 and then you'll see the flag.

<br/>

## Strings 2

The strings are a lot like before, now the start function is this:

![strings21](/images/malwaretech-strings/strings21.png)

<br/>

There are a lot of variables with a value of a hex number, for this challenge you have to convert each hex number to decimal and you'll get the flag, I've done it with python

```python
python3
>>> print(bytes.fromhex('464C41477B535441434B2D535452494E47532D4152452D424553542D535452494E47537D').decode('utf-8'))
```

<br/>

## Strings 3

This is the start function now:

![strings31](/images/malwaretech-strings/strings31.png)

In this challenge the important function is the LoadStringA that need's a string called uID, to get this uID you have to look at these lines:

![strings32](/images/malwaretech-strings/strings32.png)

So this does: move 1 to eax, shift left eax 8 times, so eax = 100, xor edx with edx so edx = 0, increment edx by 1 so edx = 1, shift left 4 times eax so EAX= 10, and then eax or edx that it's 110 and then save the value in [ebp+uID]

<br/>

110 in hex it's 272, so in the position 272 of the strings is the value of the flag, for this i'll use ghidra

<br/>

Open the defined strings window click on one value and in the disassebly you have find the String ID 275
