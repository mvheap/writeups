You can make and ssh and cd to the directory and run it from there or just script it.

```python
from pwn import *

user = ''
password = ''
host ='2019shell1.picoctf.com'

s = ssh(user=user,password=password,host=host)

p = s.run('/problems/practice-run-1_0_62b61488e896645ebff9b6c97d0e775e/run_this')

flag = p.recvline()
print(flag)
```
