We have a .java file that tere's an array with the characters unordered:

![image1](/images/picoctf2019-vaultdoor1/picoctf2019-vaultdoor1.png)

Take this and order it by the number with sublime text you can do edit -> sort lines:

![image2](/images/picoctf2019-vaultdoor1/picoctf2019-vaultdoor12.png)

And the final:

![image3](/images/picoctf2019-vaultdoor1/picoctf2019-vaultdoor13.png)
