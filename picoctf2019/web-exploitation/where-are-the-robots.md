We have this website:

![image1](/picoctf2019-where-are-the-robots/wherearetherobots1.png)

Now, by the hint robots, I'll go to `/robots.txt` and there's one disallowed entry:

![image2](/picoctf2019-where-are-the-robots/wherearetherobots2.png)

And in this directory is the flag:

![image3](/picoctf2019-where-are-the-robots/wherearetherobots3.png)
